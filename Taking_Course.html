        I am taking this class because I am interested in learning about
        front-end, and later, back-end web development. I believe that learning
        how both sides of a website work is important to any good web
        developer. I think that this class will only strengthen my skill as a
        programmer and make me a more well-rounded programmer. This class is
        also an elective course that counts towards my Computer Science degree.
